Superstore Sales and Profit Analysis
This repository contains the code and analysis for the "Superstore Sales and Profit" project. The analysis is based on the Superstore dataset, where we investigate sales performance, profit generation, and trends across various dimensions like product categories, regions, discounts, and time periods.

Dataset
The dataset used is Superstore Sales Data, which includes the following columns:

Order ID: Unique identifier for each order.
Product Name: Name of the product sold.
Sales: Sales amount for the corresponding product.
Profit: Profit generated for the sale.
Discount: Discount applied to the product.
Region, City, State: Location information related to the sales.
Order Date: Date when the order was placed.
Analysis
The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into:

Top-selling and top-profit products.
Regional sales and profit distribution.
The effect of discounts on sales and profit.
Time-based sales trends (monthly and yearly).
Key Visualizations and Insights
Top Selling Products: A bar plot shows the top 10 best-selling products. By grouping the data by Product Name and summing the sales, we visualize the top-selling items.

Top Profit Products: Similarly, products generating the most profit are highlighted. This helps identify which items contribute the most to the store's profitability.

Sales and Profit by Region: A bar plot illustrates sales and profit figures across different regions. This gives insights into regional performance.

Sales Trends Over Time: We analyze sales trends on a monthly and yearly basis to understand seasonality and growth patterns.

Impact of Discounts: By grouping data based on discounts, we analyze how varying discount rates affect both sales and profitability. This helps in determining the effectiveness of different discount strategies.

State and City Level Sales and Profit: Visualizations for state-wise and city-wise sales and profit to determine which geographical areas are driving the most revenue and profitability.
